So, having taken the suggestion from Prof. Sattler, I have finally got myself a blog.

Altough I am such a person who is not that into social network, this still can be a good place to post the “fresh” ideas from my research. Given that Dr. ZHAO (my supervisor) and I still need to have further discussions to decide which specific area/project I am going to be focusing on, I am just doing my very brief literature reviews mainly around the keyword “Text Mining” (to be honest, this is really a field I have never came across yet). Fortunately, there surely is an idea budding in my mind now. However, it is really hard to tell how far the budding idea can go. 

Cheers!!!
