Early this week, I had a discussion with my colleagues about my current understand about Domain Theory and the brief idea of my research direction which is generally focused on “Requirement Engineering”. Afterwards, I did my literature review on the “Requirement Engineering Assorted Papers” collected by James, the “Automated Negotiation” one you sent to me, and other literature related to this area.

According to these literature, the most important word behind Requirement Engineering is “Negotiation”, and this word has been defined as “the process to handle the conflicts and to resolve disagreements between the stakeholders” in “Negotiation in the Requirements Elicitation and Analysis Process” (2008). So that this area comes across not only the technical aspects (e.g. a simple technique/tool for processing requirements documents) but also human factors (e.g. collaboration & coordination). Actually, this point has been proved by Nail Maiden in his “Trust Me, I’m an Analyst” (2010) which says that “requirements projects are about people”. (There should be another paper proves that point. I just cannot find the name of it in my note right now.) In other words, when studying “Requirements Engineering”, I think we should not only focus on the technical aspects, i.e. Software Engineering, but also concentrate on real world, i.e. Business & Management. By studying how requirement engineering (RE) works in business world, we will be able to understand how we can apply our knowledge to support RE. As one of the recommendations provided in “Research Directions in Requirements Engineering” (2007), it says that “Researchers should work with practitioners. Such partnerships can help to ensure that researchers have a through understanding of the real problem that practitioners face.”, which actually states the point as same as I did.

Regarding to the paper “Research Directions…“, nine “hotspots” of future RE research have been provided. (The details of each point will not be given in this email. Otherwise it will definitely be a long one.)

- Scale;
- Security; 
- Tolerance;
- Increased Reliance on the Environment;
- Self-Management; 
- Globalisation (which addresses the problem arisen by geographically distributed stakeholders); 
- Methodologies, Patterns and Tools;
- Requirements Reuse;
- Effectiveness of RE Technologies.

Based on my understanding of the above RE hotspots and the Domain Theory, we may have good chances in “Requirement Reuse”, “Methodologies, Patterns and Tools” and even “Globalisation”.

Back to the human factors of Negotiation, I classify the current difficulties shown in literature (especially in “Why Requirements Engineering Fails: A Survey Report from China” 2010) as:

- Last-minute Requirements;
- Lack of Business Knowledge;
- Lack of Technical Knowledge: such as protocols and standards;
- Interactions between stakeholders.

Therefore, I probably see a potential direction here for us to apply Domain Theory to resolve the above issues. We may be able to find a way/method to make stakeholders negotiate or construct their requirements based on the key word “reuse”, or more precisely, “knowledge reuse”. I also noticed that several papers mentioned about “Goal-oriented”, and am trying to dig out more about it. Perhaps there are some lessons can be learnt from it.

I have also read the paper “A Negotiation Description Language” you sent to me, and find it is about another research direction – “Automated Negotiation”. In order to have a better understanding of it, several literature related to Automated Negotiation have also been reviewed. Based on my conclusions, I think “Automated Negotiation” can be described as “An (semi-) automatically process based on existing requirements”. On the other hand, “Negotiation Supporting System/Approach”, which is also a popular research direction and much close to the points I mentioned in previous paragraphs, is “the process to build requirements”. Hence, from this point of view, I currently do not see too much on how Domain Theory can contribute to Automated Negotiation. In stead, I think there may be a lack of study on applying Domain Theory or the philosophy behinds domain theory into Negotiation Supporting System/Approach. I thus prefer to choose Negotiation Supporting System/Approach to be my potential starting point in requirements engineering. However, I will also keep an eye on the possibility of composing Automated Negotiation into it. 

Hmm… Yup. I think that is my weekly report to you this week. Hope that I made myself clear. 

Cheers!!!
