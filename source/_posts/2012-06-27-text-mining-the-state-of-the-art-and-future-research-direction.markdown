Having reviewed several papers in the area of “Text Mining”, I eventually got some feelings about this field. Based on the existing researches and efforts made on Text Mining (TM), TM technologies nowadays are becoming more maturer, and have been successfully applied in several different academic and industrial areas.

Generally speaking, TM can be visualised as consisting of two phases: Text Refining that transform the unstructured documents into a kind of intermedia form, and Knowledge Distillation which deduce useful information from the intermedia forms. [1] In other words, TM aims at extracting useful knowledge or information from the relatively free-form input resource (e.g. text documents, source code and etc.). Nowadays, researches have been made in order to bring TM opportunities to benefit software engineering. For example, several approaches and techniques, which are described in [2][3][4][5] and etc., have already been developed to assist the maintenance of the existing computer systems (i.e. source code).

Since I am also supposed to do my research based on the keyword “software engineering”, the above efforts made by others surely brought me a potential research direction budding in my mind. According to the literatures I have already reviewed so far, researchers mainly focused on “locating by TM” instead of “refactoring by TM”. In [6], Arie and et al. proposed a series of promising research directions in aspect mining and refactoring. They managed to show both the possibilities and challenges in combining TM techniques with software refactoring. Based on their researches, I came up with the potential research direction that is to find a novel approach to automatically or semi-automatically refactoring the source codes in existing legacy systems to some kinds of design patterns.

Actually, this potential research project was firstly introduced by Dr. Liping ZHAO during my initial Ph.D. meeting. However, I have partly seen the possibilities and difficulties of this research direction now. 

Cheers!!!
