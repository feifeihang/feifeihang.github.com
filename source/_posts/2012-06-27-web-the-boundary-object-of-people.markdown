In social science, __boundary objects__ are being defined as “_the objects that cross the boundaries between multiple social worlds_“. A concrete example in real life is “library”. In a library, the readers are from different social worlds, e.g. some of them are doing computer science while others are dedicating to business. As a repository of knowledge, the library brings us the opportunity to get along with others from different social worlds. Therefore the library is essentially acting as a boundary object between these social worlds.

As the biggest artefact which has ever been built by humans, the __Web__ (a.k.a. __Internet__) is also being developed followed the route proposed by __Boundary Object Theory__ and its divisions. Based on the original Boundary Object Theory, Paul R. Carlile and et al. argued that a boundary object should be:

- _Syntactic_: A boundary object should has its syntax in order to be represented. The word syntax here is a weak term, which can be interpreted as meta-models or constraints or even common-accepted facts. For example, the syntax of a library can be “a building that contains different categories of books inside.”.
- _Semantic_: After being expressed based on the syntax, a boundary object should be able to be understood by the covered social worlds. For example, in business world, contracts can be described as the boundary objects between companies. Being semantic means that the contracts should be understood by the companies or any other participants which get involved in the contracts.
- _Pragmatic_: In order to coordinate the involved social worlds efficiently, boundary objects should also be pragmatic, which means that the objects should be modifiable. For instance, when negotiating contract, the original contract should be changeable in order to allow the multiple parties to get a common-accepted balance.

Looking at the history of web, it has strictly followed the above principles. When web was firstly introduced, people set standards and protocols to make it syntactic. In 1998, Tim Berners-Lee revealed the concept of Semantic Web, which essentially aims at, from the perspective of Boundary Object Theory, developing the web to be a semantic boundary object. In short, Semantic Web is going to make (the components on) the web understandable by machines which are also a part of the participants of the web. And in 1999, we welcomed the term Web 2.0, which brings the opportunity to all of us to modify and develop the web by ourselves. One of the typical examples of the Web 2.0 is the uses of blogs.

To date, the web has <s>automatically</s> followed the route proposed by Boundary Object Theory. I cannot tell what is going to happen next, but I am sure that with the research and development of Boundary Object Theory, we will find the answer from it.
