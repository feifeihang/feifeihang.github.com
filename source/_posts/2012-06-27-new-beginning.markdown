Finally, I compromised by the great limitations within the existing Text Mining techniques. In other words, the potential research direction has just been withdrawn by myself. However, there is an alternative in my mind, and has already been discussed with Dr. ZHAO.

The idea of mine is simple. In order to dig out a potential research topic instead of the TM one, I gathered all the research areas that I am either familiar with or interested in, and tried to see if I can find any promising idea. Hence I got this one: “Model-Driven Architecture / Model Transformation” + “Android Mobile Platform”. There is truly a relatively new field to be studied since the only few existing literatures that I can find are done by one research group. Therefore there is still a large number of opportunities for me to do something new or better in this direction. 

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, FEIFEI!!!
