Extremely anxious. I was mentally being stronger during the last couple of weeks because it seemed that my research was finally getting to start. Unfortunately, we eventually stepped back to the starting point, again. So that another couple of reading weeks is waiting in the corner right there right now.

Seriously, I am getting homesick, badly. But who doesn’t? Especially after leaving home for nearly two years without any home visit thereof. 

Bit headache today. Just feeling upset… Tired and fallen in blue…

Also a bit afraid that I cannot handle “automated negotiation” entirely well.

Time flows, but we are just keeping still…

Cheers!!!
