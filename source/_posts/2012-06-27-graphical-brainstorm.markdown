The papers I reviewed early this morning seem to be a bit off-topic. Although both of them proposed good approaches and brought me some brainstorms, the methods they used are basically graph-based, neither of them are text-based. However, what David Shepherd and et al. mentioned about in [1] did bring me some brief thoughts on the possibilities of introducing PDG into my research. But the feasibilities are depend on the way I expand my research. More precisely, if I just tightly focus on “Text Mining” or rely on the collaborations with NaCTeM[2], it would be better if I just stay away from PDG or AST. (not 100% sure yet)

P.S.: Please do not be offended, it made me double confirmed that I am really not that into those graphic things, such as matrix.

Cheers!!!
