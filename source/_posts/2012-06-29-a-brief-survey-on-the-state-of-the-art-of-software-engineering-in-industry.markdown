Driven by my research direction, a brief <a href="http://www.diaochapai.com/survey616582" target="_blank">survey</a> on the state of the art of software engineering in industry is being carried out these weeks. Generally speaking, this survey serves three purposes:

<!--more-->
1. To see what kind of role/how important is "Reuse" being taken in software engineering in industry.
2. To investigate the value and acceptability of communication-gap bridging approaches, e.g. Zachman Framework, BIAIT, etc., in requirements engineering phases in industry.
3. The most important. To identify by following what kind of approach/design, the output of my research can be more advanced and more helpful.

Due to the status of this survey, the current result cannot be shown here. And yet, a brief conclusion and discussion are going to be given in this post.

##"Reuse" in Industry##

Requirements projects are about people.

By looking at the collected data, it can be easily pointed out that "reuse" is truly a promising research topic since most of the participants/companies have already realised and received the benefits which they can obtain from "reuse". However, it is worth to be noticed that most of the participants claimed that they seldom applied "reuse" in software engineering phases other than development stage, whereas the design phases (including analysis, modeling, and design), for example, can also be improved by using "reuse".

Generally, the reason why "reuse" has not been commonly applied in other software engineering phases, such as requirements engineering, systems design, etc., grounds in the unpredictable human activities involved in the entire engineering life cycle. Said by Neil Maiden, requirements projects are about people. Moreover, as far as we know, most phases in software engineering projects are about people. By getting people involved, software engineering processes and even the project itself become flexible. In other words, it is, from my very own point of view, extremely difficult to model or abstract human behaviours in fine granularities in many cases. For short, it can be interrupted as it is not a good idea to model human activities since they are usually unpredictable. It should be noticed that I am not saying that human behaviours cannot be abstracted into models. What I am arguing here is sometimes we should not spend that much efforts on modelling human activities.

Therefore, back to the main topic, why most companies only applied "reuse" in development phases? The possible answer is that the cost of "reuse" in other phases can be very high. In order to make reuse possible, models/abstractions are essential. However, as mentioned above, if "reuse" is going to be used in other phases, e.g. requirements engineering, the granularity of the abstractions has to be determined wisely. Also, requirements can be seen as the expectations of clients, which means that they are about human behaviour, or at least, about people. It can be easily pointed out that it will definitely be a massive work for people to build a such practical "reuse" system or database to cover their businesses. And, the most important fact, they are bloody expensive!

##Communication Gaps##

Shown by the current result of this survey, 80% companies found difficulties in communicating with their clients. As mentioned in literature, there are communication gaps between the different parties, e.g. developers, clients, etc.. In order to fill or bridge the gaps, approaches, frameworks, and methodologies are proposed. The basic idea of them is to capture relevant requirements information from clients by asking specific questions in a well-designed order and sequence.

From my point of view, these approaches seem stunning. However, they are only stunning, __theoretically__. Illustrated by data, none of the participants always follow any of the gap-bridging approaches even though they know their existences. 40% companies follow the approaches occasionally, while 30% follow them very occasionally and 30% never apply the approaches. Given by the participants, the reason is simple, they found it is difficult to follow and use those approaches in real projects and the approaches can be unrealistic in many cases.

Similar with the previous question, this result is also driven by the flexibility and unpredictability of people.

##Solutions?##

Unfortunately, no solutions is going to be given at this very moment. Because all the above are my reports and conclusions based on the survey. I am not going to solve the problems right here right now, I am just telling the truth and unveiling the state of the art of software engineering in industry. However, sooner or later, I will definitely propose my solution to address the issues. Just keep calm and be patient. :-)


Cheers!!!
