Thanks Takashi Ishio and et al. and their [1], a promising approach for mining coding patterns has been proposed. To be fair, the idea and method they described in their paper are quite interesting to me, because by following their way for mining patterns and information, even the variants can be traced. However, besides the brilliant method they introduced, my concern is that if their approach is really TM-based.

Cheers!!!
