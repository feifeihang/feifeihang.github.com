Finally, based on the literature review, the potential research direction report has been drafted. Although I am not sure if Dr. Zhao will approve it, this is my first stab on my Ph.D. research. 

Given that I have not actually started my research yet, this writing can only be treated as a workshop paper. However, at this very early stage of my Ph.D. life, it is still enough to cheer my up. 

This link will redirect you to my report: [Towards Design Patterns](http://feifeihang.blog.com/files/2012/02/report.pdf)

Cheers!!!
