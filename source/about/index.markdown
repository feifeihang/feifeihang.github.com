Congratulations!

Finally, you found me here online.

I am currently a first year Ph.D. student. My current research interests are in HTML5 technologies, RESTful Web Services, Mashup, Service Composition and End-User Development.

An introduction of REST by Roger L. Costello can be found <a href="http://www.xfront.com/sld001.htm" target="_blank">here</a>
